1- What have you liked so far about this course?
    Personally compared to other classes everything was explained to us in a manner that was detailed and easy to
    understand. Instructor was understanding and generous to students one of best instructor I had so far at BCIT.


2- What have you disliked about this course so far?
    Some times during Lecture too much time was spent on figuring out errors and debugging but not often.


3- What would be one or more thing you would do to improve the quality of the course and course delivery?
    I think it is better to start with a working program show us examples and have us
    code it as well.


4-Did you find this exam Hard / Easy / Fair?
    Complete disaster!! Too much stuff in short period of time just going back and forth questions. Did not have enough
    time nothing seems to be working properly at the moment. Won't be able to get even close to finishing the exam.
